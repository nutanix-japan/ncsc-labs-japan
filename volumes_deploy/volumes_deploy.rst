Volumes
-----------------------

Overview
++++++++

.. note::

  Estimated time to complete: **30 Minutes**

The Nutanix Volumes feature (previously know as Acropolis Volumes) exposes back-end DSF storage to external consumers (guest OS, physical hosts, containers, etc.) via iSCSI.

This allows any operating system to access DSF and leverage its storage capabilities.  In this deployment scenario, the OS is talking directly to Nutanix bypassing any hypervisor.

Core use-cases for Acropolis Volumes:

- Shared Disks
- Oracle RAC, Microsoft Failover Clustering, etc.
- Disks as first-class entities
- Where execution contexts are ephemeral and data is critical
- Containers, OpenStack, etc.
- Guest-initiated iSCSI
- Bare-metal consumers
- Exchange on vSphere (for Microsoft Support)

Qualified Operating Systems
............................

The solution is iSCSI spec. compliant, the qualified operating systems are just those of which have been validated by QA.

- Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012 R2
- Redhat Enterprise Linux 6.0+

Configure Acropolis Block Services
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#.  Open ``https://*<POCxx-ABC Cluster IP>*:9440`` (https://10.42.xx.37:9440) in your browser and log in with the following credentials:

    - **Username** - admin
    - **Password** - *your cluster password*

#.  Click the Cluster name in the upper left hand corner to access the Cluster details

#.  Enter the Cluster External Data Services IP Address (10.42.xx.38) in your Assigned Cluster details

#.  Close Cluster Details and proceed to Configure Guests

Enable and Configure ABS in Prism for Windows
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ensure that the *initials*-Windows_VM has access to the Network:

#.  Login to Prism, navigate to the VM Dashboard, Table View, select *initials*-Windows_VM, and click Update, ensure that the VM has a NIC added, if it does not, add one now and attach it to VLAN0.

    .. figure:: images/2.png

#.  Save the VM Settings and continue to the next steps.

#.  Login to the Windows Server guest VM to get the iSCSI iqn name:

#.  Login to *initials*-Windows_VM on your assigned cluster with username “administrator” and your password. Click in the upper right hand corner of the desktop for the search window to appear.  It looks like a looking glass.  Click the Search icon.  Enter iscsi and “iscsi” and it will resolve to “iSCSI Initiator.” Start the Windows iSCSI service.

    .. figure:: images/3.png

#.  Click the “Configuration” tab to find the iqn.  Make a note of it for a later step.

    .. figure:: images/4.png

#.  Create a Volume Group in Prism:

#.  Go back to Prism UI, navigate to the Storage Dashboard, click “+ Volume Group” to create a new Volume Group, in the Volume Group Window give the volume group a name "mywindowsvg", add a new disk and select default container, input a size for the disk of 60 and click Add.

#.  Click Save.

    .. figure:: images/5.png

Connect ABS disks to Windows VM:
................................

#.  Click the VG again and find the volume group we previously created.  Click on our windows VG and click Update. Under Access Control check the box and add the iqn previously recorded.

    .. figure:: images/6.png

#.  Switch back to your windows VM.  In the console of your windows VM in the iSCSI initiator properties click on the Targets tab.  Type in the data services ip and click Quick Connect.  You will see the target volume group we previously created.

    .. figure:: images/7.png

#.  Click Done

#.  Open diskmgmt.msc from the Search menu and see the raw disk we added.  Optionally, click the disk to format and choose drive letter.

Enable and Configure ABS in Prism for Linux
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ensure that the CentOS VM has access to the Network:
Login to Prism, navigate to the VM Dashboard, Table View, select the CentOS VM, and click Update, ensure that the VM has a NIC added, if it does not, add one now and attach it to VLAN0. Save the VM Settings and continue to the next steps.

Login to the Linux guest VM to get the iSCSI iqn name:

#.  Login to CentOS on your assigned cluster with

    - Username - root
    - Password - nutanix/4u

#.  Install ISCSI Tools: If not already installed, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

      yum –y install iscsi-initiator-utils

#.  Install lsscsi tools: If not already installed, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

     yum –y install lsscsi

#.  To find the iqn name run

    .. code-block:: bash

     cat /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi

#.  Copy down the iqn name of the iSCSI client initiator

    Example:

    .. figure:: images/10.png


Create a Volume Group in Prism:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#.  Login to Prism

#.  Navigate to the Storage Dashboard

#.  Click **+ Volume Group** to create a new Volume Group

#.  In the Volume Group Window give the volume group a name ``mylinuxvg``

#.  Add a new disk and select default container, input a size for the disk of 60 and click **Add**

#.  In the Initiators section , click "Add New client", enter the iqn name of the Linux iSCSI initiator you copied down in step 5 of the previous section and click Add.

#.  Then click **Save**

Connect ABS disks to Linux VM:
..............................

#.  Discover the Nutanix ABS target by running the command

    .. code-block:: bash

      iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p <DataServicesIP>
      #It should come back with the iqn name of the Nutanix ABS target volume.  Make note of this name.

    Example:

    .. figure:: images/11.png

#.  Run the following command to verify you only see one Nutanix vDisk on ``/dev/``

    .. code-block:: bash

      lsscsi

    .. figure:: images/12.png

#.  Now login to the ABS iSCSI LUN with the target iqn you copied from the Step 1 just above.

    .. code-block:: bash

      iscsiadm  --mode node --targetname <Nutanix.iqn.name.from.step.above> --portal <DataServicesIP> --login

    .. figure:: images/13.png

#.  Check the status session of the target by running

    .. code-block:: bash

      iscsiadm --mode session --op show

#.  Run the following command again to verify you now see the new Nutanix vDisk on ``/dev/sdb``

    .. code-block:: bash

      lsscsi

    .. figure:: images/14.png

#.  Discover the Nutanix ABS target by running the following commands

    .. code-block:: bash

      iscsiadm --mode discovery –t sendtargets --portal <DataServicesIP>“
      #It should come back with the iqn name of the Nutanix ABS target volume.  Make note of this name.

    Example:

    .. figure:: images/15.png

#.  Run the following to verify you only see one Nutanix vdisk on ``/dev/sda``

    .. code-block:: bash

      lsscsi

    .. figure:: images/16.png

#.  Now login to the ABS iSCSI LUN with the target iqn you copied from the previous step.

    .. code-block:: bash

      iscsiadm  - -mode node - -targetname <Nutanix.iqn.name.from.step.above> - -portal <DataServicesIP> - -login

    .. figure:: images/17.png
